## STORY BEHIND THE APP

_Before I and my team build this app, like always, 
we doing research to find the real problem before we give an option of solution 
by using technology._

In 2018, global cancer cases is estimated 18.1 million to have risen to new cases, and 9,6 million deaths. 
WHO also predicts that cancer will be the number one cause of death, in the world. 

In Indonesia, there are many communities that supports cancer patients by providing education, 
donation and psychological support. 

Since cancer is a broad scope,
we decided to minimaze the scope only for children with cancer. 

We visited some children's cancer communities 
e.g [Komunitas Taufan](www.komunitastaufan.org), [Pita Kuning](http://pitakuning.or.id), 
and some shelter house for cancer families and patients. 

From interview, we found out that psychological issues 
take on great importance in oncology settings 
from the communication of the diagnosis to the management of the end-of-life phase.

When kid are diagnosed, their parents can be devastated. 
When parents do, other problems could emerge. 
As the result, parents canâ€™t support their child 
maximally while support from the close people are needed. 
Even though by giving support to the patient, it can motivate children to do the treatment.

So that we came with a solution concept to build an interactive iOS app (iPad) for kids with cancer, aged 5-7 years old,
to motivate them doing their treatment through motivation friend, health diary, and reminder. And we named it **Temania**.
