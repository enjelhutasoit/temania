## STORY BEHIND THE APP

_Before I and my team built this app, like always, 
we conduct research to find the real problem before we provide a solution choice
using technology._
***
In 2018, global cancer cases is estimated 18.1 million to have risen to new cases, and 9,6 million deaths. 
WHO also predicts that cancer will be the number one cause of death, in the world. 

In Indonesia, there are many communities that supports cancer patients by providing education, 
donation and psychological support. 

Since cancer is a broad scope,
we decided to minimaze the scope only for children with cancer. 

We visited several children's cancer communities 
e.g [Komunitas Taufan](www.komunitastaufan.org), [Pita Kuning](http://pitakuning.or.id), 
and several shelters for families and cancer patients. 

From the interview, we found that psychological problem
very important in the setting of oncology
from diagnostic communication to management of the final phase of life.

When children are diagnosed, their parents can be devastated. 
When parents do, other problems could emerge. 
As the result, parents canâ€™t support their child 
maximally while support from the close people are needed. 
Even though by giving support to the patient, it can motivate children to do the treatment.

So we came with a solution concept to build an interactive iOS app (iPad) for children with cancer, ages 5-7 years,
to motivate them to carry out their care through motivational friends, health diaries, and reminders. And we named it **Temania**.
